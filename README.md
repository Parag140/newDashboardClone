Approach to Building the Dashboard

The dashboard was built with a component-driven architecture using React and Tailwind CSS to ensure modularity, reusability, and a clean design. The layout comprises three main sections: a sidebar for navigation, a top progress bar, and a content area for forms and actions.

The sidebar was designed to provide consistent navigation, while the top progress bar visually tracks the user's progress through the claim filing process. The content area dynamically adapts to display forms and actions based on the user's workflow. Tailwind CSS was used to manage layout, spacing, and responsiveness, ensuring the design is flexible and modern. To ensure accessibility and usability, proper labels and placeholders were added to form elements.

Challenges Faced and Resolutions

Alignment Issues:
Initially, the sidebar and main content overlapped due to improper flexbox configuration. This was resolved by structuring the layout with flex containers and appropriately allocating flex-grow properties to ensure equal space distribution.

Responsive Design:
Ensuring the layout worked seamlessly across various screen sizes required careful testing and adjustments. Media queries and Tailwind's responsive utilities were employed to make the design adaptable.

Element Spacing and Margins:
Overlapping and inconsistent spacing between elements was another challenge. This was addressed by systematically using Tailwind’s spacing utilities like mt, mb, and p to maintain consistent margins and paddings.

Visual Hierarchy:
Distinguishing between the primary and secondary sections proved tricky in initial iterations. Adjustments such as adding subtle borders, background colors, and shadow effects improved clarity.

Assumptions Made

User Navigation:
Users will primarily interact with the sidebar and top progress bar to navigate through different stages of the claim filing process.

Standardized Inputs:
The form fields assume standard inputs (e.g., USD for currency). Additional validation mechanisms can be added later based on user requirements.

Design Consistency:
Assumed that a minimalistic design with a focus on usability would align with user expectations, avoiding overly complex layouts.

Browser Compatibility:
The application is intended for modern browsers that support Flexbox and Tailwind CSS.
